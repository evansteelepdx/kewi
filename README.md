This is my grand plan to make a library thing that should make it a lot easier to create scripts and run them. There will be multiple ways to run scripts but one of them will be via a discord bot. I've got SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO many plans and ideas of how to make this amazing and good, lets see how far I get!


## Usage / Installation
At the moment this is pretty specialized to just my use case but if you really wanted to try running it yourself, feel free. Theres some pip modules you'll probably need that i haven't created a list of yet. You can load a bash alias to the cli by sourceing this in ur bash startup `src/cli/register.sh`. And you could install the kewi module/library to ur machine by doin `python -m pip install -e .` in the `src/kewi` dir. Oh also you'll probably need to create a new globals.json at `src/kewi/globals/globals.json`. Theres an example file there to show u the structure.
