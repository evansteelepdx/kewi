This is my grand plan to make a library thing that should make it a lot easier to create scripts and run them. There will be multiple ways to run scripts but one of them will be via a discord bot. I've got SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO many plans and ideas of how to make this amazing and good, lets see how far I get!
